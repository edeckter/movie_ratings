# Scoring Movie Reviews using Natural Language Processing
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook (Python code) and report for a project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assign a score between 0 and 1 to movie reviews.  These scores are subsequently averaged for each movie to create an aggregate rating for each file.

## Data Sources
The data for building and testing the model came was a subset of Amazon movie reviews compiled by Stanford University's SNAP group [https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html).

The out-of-sample movie reviews came from various news publications and were compiled on the website Rotten Tomatoes:
* [21 Bridges](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/21_bridges/reviews?type=top_critics)
* [Joker](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joker_2019/reviews?type=top_critics)
* [Knives Out](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/knives_out/reviews?type=top_critics)
* [Rambo: Last Blood](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rambo_last_blood/reviews?type=top_critics)
